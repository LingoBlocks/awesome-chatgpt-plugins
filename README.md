### What are ChatGPT plugins?

ChatGPT is a powerful language model that can be used to build conversational AI applications. ChatGPT plugins are a collection of pre-built functionalities and features that can be added to ChatGPT models to enhance their performance.

### Why use ChatGPT plugins?

Using ChatGPT plugins can save developers valuable time by allowing them to quickly add pre-built functionalities to their models, rather than building everything from scratch. Additionally, many ChatGPT plugins are open source, which means they can be easily customized and tweaked to fit specific use cases.

### Plugins

Here are some great ChatGPT plugins available:

- GPT-3 with Hugging Face: Official implementation of GPT-3 from OpenAI, with easy-to-use API wrapper from Hugging Face.
- GPT-2 Fine-tuned for Chatbot Conversations: A fine-tuned version of GPT-2 for generating chatbot-like responses.
- Knowledge Graph: A plugin that allows ChatGPT models to incorporate external knowledge sources such as structured data or ontologies.
- Multi-turn Conversation Tracking: A plugin that enables tracking of conversations across multiple sessions.
- Contextualization: A plugin that helps ChatGPT models to maintain context in their conversations.
