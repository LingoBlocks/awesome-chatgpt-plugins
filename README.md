### What are ChatGPT plugins?

ChatGPT plugins are add-ons that allow ChatGPT to connect with official and third-party APIs. These plugins enhance ChatGPT's abilities by enabling it to perform various tasks, such as retrieving real-time information (e.g., sports scores), accessing knowledge bases (e.g., company documents), and taking actions on behalf of users (e.g., booking flights).

## Official Plugins

- [Retrieval Plugin](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin): Enables semantic search and retrieval of personal or organizational documents.
- [Browsing](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#browsing): An experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet.
- [Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter): Lets users interact with a secure Python interpreter during a chat conversation, allowing them to run code, build on previous code, and upload or download files.


## Third-party Plugins

- GPT-3 with Hugging Face: Official implementation of GPT-3 from OpenAI, with easy-to-use API wrapper from Hugging Face.
- Knowledge Graph: A plugin that allows ChatGPT models to incorporate external knowledge sources such as structured data or ontologies.
- Multi-turn Conversation Tracking: A plugin that enables tracking of conversations across multiple sessions.
- Contextualization: A plugin that helps ChatGPT models to maintain context in their conversations.
- Named Entity Recognition: A plugin that identifies names of persons, organizations, locations, and other entities in text.
